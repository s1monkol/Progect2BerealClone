# Project 2 - BeReal Clone Pt. 1

Submitted by: **Semen Kolesnykov**

**BeReal Clone Pt. 1** is an iOS app that allows users to create an account, log in, and post images with captions to a shared feed. It mimics some of the core functionalities of the BeReal app, with backend support using Parse via Back4App.

Time spent: **~10 hours** in total

## üé• App Walkthrough

> **Note:** Unfortunately, this is the only form of demonstration I can provide. I‚Äôve been working exclusively on FIU library computers, which in 95% of cases failed to run iOS simulators due to extremely outdated and underpowered hardware. Additionally, these machines do not allow installation of third-party recording software such as OBS or screen capture tools.  
> I have included screenshots and GIF walkthroughs with detailed code explanations to demonstrate the app‚Äôs core functionality.

## üìù Notes

- The main challenge was testing on a physical device due to lack of simulator support in the iMac environment.
- Initial Parse SDK integration required careful handling of async logic.
- Uploading and previewing images with `PHPickerViewController` and camera flow needed custom delegate handling.
